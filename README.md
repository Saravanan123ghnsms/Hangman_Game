# Hangman Game

This project is a simple Hangman game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game includes a dynamic background video and interactive game elements, providing a fun and engaging user experience.

## Features

- **Background Video**: A full-screen video background that enhances the visual appeal of the game.
- **Category Selection**: Choose from different categories such as Animals, Birds, Vehicles, and Food Items.
- **Interactive Game**: Players can guess letters to reveal a hidden word. The game tracks incorrect guesses and displays the number of attempts left.
- **Reset Functionality**: After the game ends, players can reset the game to start over.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the game elements and the video background.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling the game logic, including guessing letters, updating the display, and managing attempts.

## How to Run

1. Ensure all files are in the same directory.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start playing the game.

## Notes

- The game background video is set to autoplay, mute, and loop to provide a continuous visual experience.
- Ensure the video file is in the same directory as `index.html` or update the `src` attribute in the `<video>` tag accordingly.

Feel free to modify and enhance the game as desired!
